# Changelog

All notable changes to PrintForge are documented here.

## [v2.9.10] — 2026-04-15 (current)

### Fixed
- **calculateCost crash for materialless components** — Components with `materialId = null` and no sub-materials (e.g. unassigned gcode imports) no longer crash Prisma. Machine time cost is still calculated; material cost is zero.
- **purgeWasteGrams ignored in cost calculation** — `calculateJobCost()` now respects recorded `purgeWasteGrams` from job data as a middle-priority fallback (gcode-parsed volume → job-recorded waste → settings × color changes).

### Added
- **Tailscale support for remote printers** — `validateMoonrakerUrl()` now allows Tailscale CGNAT range `100.64.0.0/10` (`100.64.x.x`–`100.127.x.x`), enabling printers at other locations to connect via a Tailscale overlay network. Printer detail form shows a hint about supported URL formats including Tailscale IPs.

## [v2.10.2] — 2026-04-14 (previous)

### Added
- **Backend Stability & Validation**
  - Existence checks (404) added to `ExpensesService` and `JobsService` to prevent Prisma internal errors.
  - Strict enum validation for status filters in `QuotesService`, `OrdersService`, and `JobsService`, removing unsafe `as any` casts.
  - Linked entity verification (`orderId`, `productId`) in production job creation.
- **UX Hardening (Frontend)**
  - Replaced all native `confirm()` and `prompt()` calls with shadcn `Dialog` components across 6 major pages (Expenses, Products, Printers, Inventory, Locations, Customer Quotes).
  - Added loading/disabled states to all critical action buttons (Convert to Order, Create Invoice, Delete actions) to prevent double-submissions.
  - Implemented `try/catch` error handling with `toast` notifications for all async operations.
- **Crash Prevention**
  - Added null-guards for array mappings (`productionJobs`, `invoices`, `expensesByCategory`) across the dashboard and detail pages.

## [v2.9] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Real-time WebSocket frontend** (Step 4)
  - `apps/app/src/lib/use-websocket.ts` — `useWebSocket()` hook backed by a shared `socket.io-client` instance; auto-reconnects, exposes `printerStatuses`, `jobProgress`, `lastNotification`, `connected`
  - Socket.IO server path set to `/api/socket.io/` so it routes through the existing nginx `/api/` proxy (no nginx changes needed)
  - Printer detail page now receives live Moonraker status via WebSocket events instead of `setInterval` polling every 10 s
  - `WsNotifications` component (mounted in root layout) surfaces `notification` WebSocket events as toasts
  - `completeJob` and `failJob` in `JobsService` now broadcast `notification` events to all connected clients (job name + reason in message)
  - `ProductionModule` imports `WebSocketModule` so `EventsGateway` can be injected into `JobsService`

- **PWA enhancements** (Step 5)
  - Service worker (`public/sw.js`) rewritten with versioned caches, stale-while-revalidate for static assets, proper offline fallback for API calls, font caching, and explicit Socket.IO bypass
  - `InstallPrompt` component — captures `beforeinstallprompt`, shows a fixed bottom install bar; dismissal persisted in localStorage
  - `OfflineIndicator` component — shows amber top bar whenever `navigator.onLine` is false
  - PNG icons generated (`public/icons/icon-192x192.png`, `public/icons/icon-512x512.png`) — blue circle with white inner block, RGBA with anti-aliased edges
  - `manifest.json` updated with all four PNG icon entries (192 + 512, `any` + `maskable` purpose)
  - `InstallPrompt`, `OfflineIndicator`, `WsNotifications` all mounted in root layout

### Changed
- `EventsGateway` path changed from default `/socket.io` to `/api/socket.io/` (aligns with NestJS global prefix so nginx routes correctly)
- `JobsService` constructor now accepts `@Optional() EventsGateway` — won't break if WebSocketModule is not in scope

## [v2.8] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Failed Print Tracking** — Full failure lifecycle for production jobs
  - `POST /jobs/:id/fail` — Mark job as failed with reason + waste grams, auto-deducts waste proportionally from assigned spools
  - `POST /jobs/:id/reprint` ��� Clone failed job into new QUEUED job linked via `reprintOfId`

  - Job detail page: "Mark Failed" button with reason + waste input, failure info card (red), "Reprint" button on failed jobs, reprint chain display
  - Production list page: failure stats summary cards (total jobs, failed, failure rate, wasted filament)

- **Job Scheduling / Auto-distribution** — Automated printer assignment for queued jobs
  - `POST /jobs/auto-assign` — Auto-assign all unassigned QUEUED jobs: prefers product's default printer, load-balances by fewest active jobs, excludes MAINTENANCE/ERROR/OFFLINE printers
  - `GET /jobs/queue` — Queue view grouped by printer with ordered job lists + unassigned bucket
  - Production page: "Auto-Assign" button, List/Queue view toggle, per-printer queue cards with job order, unassigned jobs highlighted in amber

  - `GET /printers/:id/maintenance` — Maintenance history
  - `GET /printers/maintenance/overdue` — List all printers with overdue maintenance
  - `PATCH /printers/:id/maintenance-settings` — Set maintenance interval in hours
  - Printer detail page: maintenance due warning banner, start/complete buttons, interval settings, history table, print hours stat
  - Printer list page: "Overdue" and "In Maintenance" badges, print hours display

### Changed
- Job completion now accumulates print hours on the printer (`totalPrintHours`)
- Job `findOne` now includes `reprintOf` and `reprints` relations
- Printer `findOne` now includes `maintenanceLogs` and maintenance count
- Printer `findAll` includes `maintenanceLogs` count for badge rendering

### Schema Changes (requires `prisma db push`)
- `ProductionJob`: added `failureReason String?`, `failedAt DateTime?`, `wasteGrams Float @default(0)`, `reprintOfId String?` (self-relation via "Reprints")
- `Printer`: added `totalPrintHours Float @default(0)`, `maintenanceIntervalHours Float?`, `nextMaintenanceDue DateTime?`
- `MaintenanceLog`: new model — `printerId`, `type` (SCHEDULED/UNSCHEDULED/CALIBRATION), `description`, `scheduledDate`, `completedDate`, `downtimeMinutes`, `cost`, `performedById`, `notes`
- `NotificationType`: added `MAINTENANCE_DUE`

## [v2.7] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Security Hardening** — Helmet middleware with CSP directives, X-Frame-Options, HSTS; 3-tier rate limiting (short/medium/long) via @nestjs/throttler; stricter auth limits (5 login/min, 3 signup/min); CORS origin from env var
- **CSV Export** — 6 export endpoints (materials, spools, products, orders, jobs, customers) with formula injection prevention (prefixes `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, `\r` sanitized with `'`), date range filters on orders/jobs, admin-only customer export
- **Internationalization** — `LocaleProvider` React context for multi-currency/locale, public `/api/settings/locale` endpoint, settings UI for currency code, decimal places, locale, date format; defaults to OMR/en-GB/3 decimals
- **Test Coverage** — 44 unit tests across 3 suites:
  - `csv-export.spec.ts` (11 tests) — headers, custom labels, null handling, comma/quote escaping, formula injection (4 prefix types), empty rows, numerics, booleans
  - `costing.service.spec.ts` (10 tests) — single/multi-material cost, waste from color changes, purgeVolumeGrams override, global hourly rate fallback, zero materials, hexToLuminance, transition purge calculations
  - `gcode-parser.service.spec.ts` (23 tests) — slicer detection (PrusaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/Cura), time parsing (PrusaSlicer/Cura), filament grams/mm, layer height, filament type, nozzle/bed temp, filament colors, tool changes, multi-tool grams, color-to-tool mapping, single-tool, Buffer input, empty input, parseHeader

### Changed

## [v2.6] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Production Hybrid Module** — Stock-aware production planning linked to products and orders
  - `GET /jobs/plan/:orderId` — Preview production plan with deficit calculation per component
  - `POST /jobs/plan/:orderId` — Create production jobs from plan with optional overrides
  - `POST /jobs/:id/complete` — Complete job, increment stockOnHand, deduct spool weight
  - Plan preview dialog on order detail page with editable quantities, printer, and spool selection
- **ComponentMaterial join table** — Multicolor products store 1 component with N sub-materials instead of N separate components (e.g. Draco bust = 1 component, 4 filament colors)
- **Default Printer per Product** — `defaultPrinterId` on Product, auto-assigned during G-code onboarding (HI for multicolor, Ender for single-color), editable dropdown on product detail page
- **Stock on Hand** — `stockOnHand` field on ProductComponent tracks pre-printed finished units, editable inline in BOM table
- **Spool Selection Logic** — Production planner picks spool with lowest weight that has ≥ required + 50g buffer, falls back to spool with most stock
- **Multicolor BOM Display** — Product detail page shows sub-material badges with per-material stock status for multicolor components
- **Production Plan UI** — Order detail "Plan Production" button (for CONFIRMED/PENDING orders) with preview dialog showing sub-materials, spool suggestions, editable quantities and printer per component

### Changed
- G-code BOM onboarding now uses `filament_colour` hex as source of truth for material matching via RGB Euclidean distance to 19 named colors, auto-creates materials if type+color not found (`a3951a1`)
- `ProductComponent.materialId` is now nullable (multicolor components use ComponentMaterial entries instead)
- Order material availability check skips multicolor components (handled via ComponentMaterial)
- Product controller: static-prefix routes (`components/:id`, `active`) moved before parameterized `:id` route to prevent shadowing (`718e7b3`)

### Fixed
- **Component delete "not found"** — `DELETE /products/components/:componentId` was shadowed by `DELETE /products/:id` due to NestJS route ordering (`718e7b3`)
- **G-code upload "Upload failed" popup** — Frontend now reloads data even if response fails (nginx proxy timeout), shows HTTP status in error message (`925818b`)
- **G-code BOM all same material** — Was matching by type only (first PLA wins), now matches by type+color using hex-to-name mapping (`a3951a1`)

### OCR Scanner Improvements (v2.5.1–v2.5.4)
- **QR Code Brand Detection** — jsqr decodes spool QR → domain mapped to brand (esun3d→eSUN, bambulab→Bambu, etc.) (`f5888f2`)
- **Fuzzy Label Matching** — Levenshtein distance with 50% tolerance for OCR-mangled labels (`f3d6d88`, `2adfe86`)
- **Weight Digit Normalization** — `T/t/I/i/l→1`, `O→0`, accepts `hg` as fuzzy `kg` (`2adfe86`)
- **Editable Scan Review** — All 6 fields editable before saving, brand datalist with known brands (`12ebea8`)
- **Otsu Binarization** — Pure B/W preprocessing for better OCR accuracy (`8d47bc3`)
- **Color Cleanup** — Strips non-alpha suffixes, drops trailing 1-2 letter words, title-cases (`8d47bc3`)

### Schema Changes (requires `prisma db push`)
- `Product`: added `defaultPrinterId` (nullable FK to Printer)
- `ProductComponent`: added `stockOnHand` (Int, default 0), `isMultiColor` (Boolean, default false), `materialId` now nullable
- `ProductionJob`: added `productId`, `componentId` (nullable FKs), `quantityToProduce` (Int, default 1)
- `ComponentMaterial`: new model — `componentId`, `materialId`, `gramsUsed`, `colorIndex`, `sortOrder`, unique on `[componentId, colorIndex]`
- `Printer`: added `defaultProducts` relation
